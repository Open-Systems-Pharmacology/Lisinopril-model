The presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of a PBPK model for Lisinopril in healthy adults.


Lisinopril is an oral, long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. 
It reduces blood pressure by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation and decreased aldosterone secretion. 
Unlike many ACE inhibitors, lisinopril is a hydrophilic compound that does not undergo hepatic metabolism and is excreted unchanged in the urine. 
Its absorption is moderate, with approximately 25% of the administered dose reaching systemic circulation, and peak plasma concentrations occurring 6-8 hours after oral administration. 
Food intake does not significantly affect its absorption.

Lisinopril follows a biphasic pharmacokinetic profile, with an initial distribution phase and a prolonged terminal phase, which reflects its strong binding to ACE rather than drug accumulation. 
Its elimination occurs primarily through renal excretion, with a consistent clearance profile across different doses. 
The drug has an effective accumulation half-life of approximately 12 hours, supporting once-daily dosing for sustained blood pressure control.
